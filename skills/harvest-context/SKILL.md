# Harvest Context

Unified entry point for extracting, generating, and managing project context. Each subcommand captures a different type of knowledge artifact, with a shared pattern of scanning existing state, checking for overlaps, and saving to the right location.

## When to Use

- After a productive session, extract what you learned
- After orchestration, capture decisions and patterns
- When the codebase needs documentation (AGENTS.md hierarchy)
- When session knowledge should become a reusable skill, agent, or rule
- When project memory needs updating

## Subcommands

### `/harvest-context session` — Extract Session Context

Extract decisions, patterns, and learnings from the current session.

**Process:**
1. Review the full conversation for:
   - Decisions made (and why)
   - Patterns discovered
   - Errors encountered and solutions
   - Architecture choices
   - Things that worked well
   - Things that didn't work
2. Classify each item:
   - **Durable project fact** → project memory
   - **Temporary working note** → notepad
   - **Reusable procedure** → potential skill/rule
   - **Duplicate/stale** → skip
3. Present summary to user for review
4. Save to appropriate destinations

**Output:** `.opencode/state/harvest/session-{timestamp}.md` + promotions to memory/notepad/wiki

**Reminder:**
> Session: I'll review our conversation, extract key decisions, patterns, and learnings, then classify them for memory, notepad, or reusable artifacts.

### `/harvest-context codebase` — Generate Codebase Context

Run deepinit to create/update hierarchical AGENTS.md documentation across the codebase.

**Process:**
1. Map all directories (excluding node_modules, .git, dist, etc.)
2. Generate AGENTS.md files with Purpose, Key Files, Subdirectories, AI Agent Instructions
3. Create parent reference links for navigation
4. Preserve `<!-- MANUAL -->` sections in existing files
5. Validate all parent references resolve

**Delegates to:** `deepinit` skill

**Output:** Hierarchical AGENTS.md files across the codebase

**Reminder:**
> Codebase: I'll generate hierarchical AGENTS.md documentation across your codebase, preserving any manual sections in existing files.

---

### `/harvest-context skill` — Create a Skill

Create a reusable skill from session knowledge.

**Process:**
1. Identify the repeatable workflow or procedure from the session
2. Ask: "What should this skill be called? What triggers it?"
3. Structure the knowledge into a SKILL.md with:
   - YAML frontmatter (name, description, level)
   - Procedural workflow steps
   - When-to-use triggers
   - Examples
4. Save to `.opencode/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` (project) or `~/.config/opencode/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` (user)
5. Ask: "Project or user scope?"

**Delegates to:** `skill-creator` skill for complex skills

**Output:** `.opencode/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` or `~/.config/opencode/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`

**Reminder:**
> Skill: I'll extract a repeatable workflow from our session, structure it as a skill with triggers and steps, and save it for future reuse.

---

### `/harvest-context agent` — Create an Agent

Create a project-specific agent definition.

**Process:**
1. Identify the agent role needed from session context
2. Ask: "What should this agent be called? What's its primary focus?"
3. Structure as agent markdown with:
   - Description and when-to-use
   - System prompt / instructions
   - Model preference (if any)
   - Tools it should have access to
4. Save to `.opencode/agents/{name}.md` (project) or `~/.config/opencode/agents/{name}.md` (user)

**Delegates to:** `opencode-agent-creator` skill

**Output:** `.opencode/agents/{name}.md` or `~/.config/opencode/agents/{name}.md`

**Reminder:**
> Agent: I'll define a specialized agent from our session's needs, including its role, instructions, and tool access.

---

### `/harvest-context rule` — Create a Project Rule

Create a project rule in `.opencode/rules/`.

**Process:**
1. Identify the convention, pattern, or constraint from the session
2. Ask: "What should this rule be called? (e.g., api-conventions, error-handling)"
3. Write a focused rule file covering:
   - The convention or constraint
   - Examples of correct and incorrect usage
   - When the rule applies
4. Save to `.opencode/rules/{name}.md`
5. Verify `.opencode/opencode.jsonc` includes the rules path

**Output:** `.opencode/rules/{name}.md`

**Reminder:**
> Rule: I'll capture a convention or constraint from our session as a project rule that agents will automatically load.

---

### `/harvest-context command` — Create a Slash Command

Create a project slash command.

**Process:**
1. Identify the repeatable workflow that warrants a command
2. Ask: "What should the command be called? What's its description?"
3. Structure as command markdown with:
   - YAML frontmatter (description, invoke name, argument-hint)
   - Usage examples
   - Task section invoking the appropriate skill(s)
4. Save to `.opencode/commands/{name}.md`

**Delegates to:** `opencode-command-creator` skill

**Output:** `.opencode/commands/{name}.md`

**Reminder:**
> Command: I'll create a slash command that wraps a repeatable workflow, making it accessible with a single invocation.

---

### `/harvest-context memory` — Promote to Memory

Promote session knowledge to durable project memory, notepad, or wiki.

**Process:**
1. Scan session for facts worth preserving
2. Classify each item:
   - Project memory (`.opencode/state/project-memory.json`) — durable team knowledge
   - Notepad (`.opencode/state/notepad.md`) — high-signal context for next turns
   - Wiki (`wiki` skill) — persistent knowledge base articles
   - AGENTS.md updates — facts that belong in instructions
3. Present proposed promotions to user
4. Write approved items to the appropriate destination
5. Flag conflicts or duplicates with existing entries

**Delegates to:** `remember` skill for classification, `wiki` skill for articles

**Output:** Updated memory/notepad/wiki files

**Reminder:**
> Memory: I'll review what we've learned, classify it as project memory, session notes, wiki articles, or AGENTS.md updates, and save it to the right place.

---

### `/harvest-context docs` — Fetch Library Documentation

Fetch up-to-date documentation for any library, framework, or package using Context7 MCP.

**Process:**
1. Resolve the library name to a Context7-compatible ID
2. Query documentation for the specified topic (or general docs if no topic)
3. Present results with headers, code blocks, and key concepts highlighted
4. Optional: save as a context file in `.opencode/context/`

**Delegates to:** Context7 MCP (resolve-library-id + query-docs)

**Usage:**
- `/harvest-context docs react` — General React documentation
- `/harvest-context docs react hooks` — React hooks topic
- `/harvest-context docs next.js app router` — Next.js App Router

**Output:** Documentation content on screen, optionally saved to `.opencode/context/`

**Reminder:**
> Docs: I'll fetch up-to-date official documentation for any library using Context7. Give me a library name and optional topic.

---

### `/harvest-context decompose` — Decompose Concepts

Break down concepts, problems, goals, or code into smaller actionable units.

**Process:**
1. Identify the type: concept, problem, goal, feature, code component
2. Analyze structure: find natural boundaries, dependencies, relationships
3. Break down into hierarchical or sequential smaller units
4. Prioritize actionability — units should be concrete and executable

**Delegates to:** `planner` agent

**Output:** Structured decomposition with units, dependencies, effort estimates, and recommended sequence

**Reminder:**
> Decompose: I'll break down your concept, problem, or goal into smaller, independently actionable units with dependencies and effort estimates.

---

### `/harvest-context context` — Manage Context Files

Manage OpenCode context files for knowledge persistence and organization.

**Process:**
1. **No args or `map`**: Scan workspace for harvestable summary files and show context structure
2. **`harvest [path]`**: Convert summaries to permanent context files in MVI format
3. **`extract from <source>`**: Create context from documentation, URLs, or code
4. **`organize <category>`**: Restructure flat files into function-based structure
5. **`compact <file>`**: Reduce verbose file to MVI format (under 200 lines)

**Usage:**
- `/harvest-context context` — Scan and show status
- `/harvest-context context harvest` — Convert summaries to context
- `/harvest-context context extract from https://docs.example.com` — Extract from URL
- `/harvest-context context organize concepts/` — Organize by function
- `/harvest-context context compact verbose.md` — Compact a file

**Output:** Context files in `.opencode/context/` organized by function

**Reminder:**
> Context: I'll manage your context files — harvest summaries, extract from docs, organize by function, or compact verbose files.

## Shared Lifecycle

Every subcommand follows this pattern:

### Step 1: Scan Existing State

```bash
# Check for relevant prior artifacts
ls .opencode/state/harvest/ 2>/dev/null
ls .opencode/state/ideation/ 2>/dev/null
ls .opencode/state/orchestration/ 2>/dev/null
```

If overlapping artifacts exist, ask user: "Found prior harvest on [topic]. Use as context, overwrite, or skip?"

### Step 2: Execute Subcommand

Load and execute the appropriate skill or inline process (see each subcommand above).

### Step 3: Save Artifact

Write the output to the appropriate location:

| Subcommand | Save Location |
|------------|---------------|
| `session` | `.opencode/state/harvest/session-{ts}.md` + promotions |
| `codebase` | `{directory}/AGENTS.md` files across codebase |
| `skill` | `.opencode/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` or `~/.config/opencode/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` |
| `agent` | `.opencode/agents/{name}.md` or `~/.config/opencode/agents/{name}.md` |
| `rule` | `.opencode/rules/{name}.md` |
| `command` | `.opencode/commands/{name}.md` |
| `memory` | `.opencode/state/project-memory.json`, `notepad.md`, wiki articles |
| `docs` | On screen, optionally `.opencode/context/` |
| `decompose` | On screen, optionally `.opencode/context/` |
| `context` | `.opencode/context/` organized by function |

### Step 4: Confirm and Print

```
✓ Harvested: {artifact type}
  Saved to: {file path}
  {Description of what was created}

Related:
  - /ideation to plan next steps
  - /orchestrate to execute a plan
```

## No-Argument Behavior

When invoked without arguments (`/harvest-context`), use the `question` tool to present:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "What context do you want to harvest?",
    "header": "Harvest",
    "options": [
      { "label": "session", "description": "Extract decisions, patterns, learnings from current session" },
      { "label": "codebase", "description": "Generate hierarchical AGENTS.md across the codebase" },
      { "label": "skill", "description": "Create a reusable skill from session knowledge" },
      { "label": "agent", "description": "Create a project-specific agent" },
      { "label": "rule", "description": "Create a project rule (.opencode/rules/)" },
      { "label": "command", "description": "Create a project slash command" },
      { "label": "memory", "description": "Promote durable knowledge to project memory, notepad, or wiki" },
      { "label": "docs", "description": "Fetch official library documentation for any package" },
      { "label": "decompose", "description": "Break down a concept or goal into smaller actionable units" },
      { "label": "context", "description": "Manage context files — harvest, extract, organize, compact, map" }
    ]
  }]
}
```

## Scope Selection

For `skill` and `agent`, ask user about scope:

- **Project** (`.opencode/skills/` or `.opencode/agents/`) — specific to this project, committed to VCS
- **User** (`~/.config/opencode/skills/` or `~/.config/opencode/agents/`) — available across all projects

Default to project scope unless user specifies otherwise.

## Overlap Detection

Before creating a new skill, agent, or rule, check if something similar already exists:

```bash
# Check for existing artifacts with similar names
ls .opencode/skills/*/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null
ls .opencode/agents/*.md 2>/dev/null
ls .opencode/rules/*.md 2>/dev/null
ls ~/.config/opencode/skills/*/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null
ls ~/.config/opencode/agents/*.md 2>/dev/null
```

If overlap found: "A similar '{name}' already exists at {path}. Update it, or create a new one with a different name?"

## Post-Orchestration Harvest

When invoked after `/orchestrate`, automatically scan:

1. `.opencode/state/orchestration/` for completion reports
2. `.opencode/state/orchestration/progress/` for stage reports
3. `.opencode/state/orchestration/checkpoints/` for decision records

Extract decisions, patterns, and lessons learned into the appropriate artifact type.
